    "Task 1: For add_lines, I designed a dynamic function that effectively manages the lines data by employing various \n",
    "data structures. In this function I build three dictionaries; lines, terminals, and routes. The lines dictionary \n",
    "stores line information by a unique line ID with its `terminal name` and corresponding stopping `time` for every \n",
    "terminal on a line. The terminals dictionary stores terminal information by `terminal_name` as the key with its \n",
    "values corresponding to the lines and times at which the lines stop at each terminal. For my later functions, I \n",
    "strategically added a routes terminal dictionary to consolidate data into a single, accessible format. This data \n",
    "structure reduces look ups to multiple structures, reducing the overall time complexity of my algorithm. It stores \n",
    "`(current_line, prev_time, terminal_name,  time)` in a dictionary with the previous terminal as the key. Additionally, \n",
    "this dictionary helps simulate the vital process of keeping track of your past paths when traversing nodes during \n",
    "Dijkstra’s algorithm in Task 4. Overall, this function uses a combination of complex data structures like dictionaries, \n",
    "tuples, and lists to execute an efficient algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "Task 2: For lines_stopping_at, I employed a sorting algorithm and various dynamic data structures to implement this \n",
    "function effectively. I initially called `insertion_sort`, which ran a for loop and inserted a new element in a list \n",
    "based on `time` with overall complexity O(n). I planned to implement this function in my lines_stoping_at algorithm;\n",
    "however, that time complexity was O(n^2), which wasn’t very efficient, especially for large datasets, so I pivoted \n",
    "my approach. I then consider using an alternative sorting algorithm or python’s built in sorted( ) function. For \n",
    "sorted( ) the worst case running time is O(n lg n) whereas according to the CLRS textbook the worst case and average\n",
    "case/expected running time for mergeSort is Θ(n lg n). Therefore, I decided to implement meregSort’s divide and \n",
    "conquer methodology, considering python’s sorted( ) function didn’t improve the time complexity of my algorithm. \n",
    "Additionally, mergeSort’s time complexity ensured my function would have an asymptotically tight bound and deliver \n",
    "consistent running times regardless of input size. I also chose to implement a list comprehension over a standard \n",
    "loop because it provides a concise method for taking a preexisting list, checking a condition, and returning a new \n",
    "list. Overall, this function utilizes dictionary data structures for efficient lookup and retrieval, list comprehensions \n",
    "for readability, and it implements a mergeSort algorithm (seen in class) to return a sorted list of lines based on \n",
    "time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Task 3: For the best_direct_connection function I tried various approaches before settling on this design. Initially,\n",
    "I built an algorithm that incorporated nested loops, making my algorithm’s running time O(n x m) which was inefficient. \n",
    "I considered implementing a two pointer technique to ensure my list was traversed at most n times; however, that \n",
    "required sorting my terminals based on time which again posed the question of what was the most efficient sorting \n",
    "algorithm given our library restrictions. Instead, I implemented `origin_stops` and `dest_stops` dictionaries for \n",
    "more efficient access and matching of line IDs and times. With this design, the terminals dictionary for origin and \n",
    "destination are each traversed once, significantly reducing the overall time complexity of the algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "Task 4: For next_fastest_connection, I modeled the function after Dijkstra’s Algorithm using various data structures \n",
    "for optimization.First, I used a double ended queue with a tuple containing the time, origin, and path. Deque \n",
    "allows for efficient pop and append operations, which help simulate the essential priority queue needed to effectively \n",
    "implement Dijjstra’s Algorithm. I create a dictionary mapping each terminal to inf (acting as a high initial value),\n",
    "which simulates setting each unseen node to infinity, like in the algorithm. Since `heapq` was not permitted, I \n",
    "simulated the priority queue using deque() and python’s sorted() function. In this case, I chose to use python’s \n",
    "sorted( ) function because other sorting algorithms (like meregeSort which I used before) bore no pragmatic \n",
    "significance on improving the overall time complexity of the algorithm. Instead, sorted() provided an efficient \n",
    "(given the library restrictions) and readable methodology for simulating a priority queue. This algorithm made use \n",
    "of the deque data structure by implementing popleft() to extract elements at the front of the queue and append() \n",
    "to add elements to the end of the queue. However, the success of this algorithm’s design is dependent on the route's\n",
    "dictionary. The routes dictionary combines information from the terminals and lines dictionary into a single \n",
    "structure that maps each terminal to its next terminal with departure and arrival time information. This data \n",
